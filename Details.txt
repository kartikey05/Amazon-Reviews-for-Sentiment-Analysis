About Dataset
This dataset consists of a few million Amazon customer reviews (input text) and star ratings (output labels) for learning how to train fastText for sentiment analysis.

The idea here is a dataset is more than a toy - real business data on a reasonable scale - but can be trained in minutes on a modest laptop.

Content
The fastText supervised learning tutorial requires data in the following format:

__label__<X> __label__<Y> ... <Text>
where X and Y are the class names. No quotes, all on one line.

In this case, the classes are __label__1 and __label__2, and there is only one class per row.

__label__1 corresponds to 1- and 2-star reviews, and __label__2 corresponds to 4- and 5-star reviews.

(3-star reviews i.e. reviews with neutral sentiment were not included in the original),

The review titles, followed by ':' and a space, are prepended to the text.

Most of the reviews are in English, but there are a few in other languages, like Spanish.

Source
The data was lifted from Xiang Zhang's Google Drive dir, but it was in .csv format, not suitable for fastText.

Training and Testing
Follow the basic instructions at fastText supervised learning tutorial to set up the directory.

To train:

./fasttext supervised -input train.ft.txt -output model_amzn
This should take a few minutes.

To test:

./fasttext test model_amzn.bin test.ft.txt
Expect precision and recall of 0.916 if all is in order.

You can also train and test in Python, see Kernel.
